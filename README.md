# Disc Spring Calculator and Tools

## Introduction

This repositiory is constructed using the [*Schnoor Handbook for Disc Springs*](http://www.industrialbearings.com.au/uploads/catalogs/schnorrhandbook_1343111178.pdf), which uses the DIN 2092 Standard for Disc Spring Computation.

The first step is constructing a *Disc Spring* Object using input parameters and then using these objects for comparison, evaluation and plotting. There are four ways to use the code:

1. Single Spring Input
2. Table Spring Input
3. Brute Force Bounded Input
4. Optimization based on Objectives & Constraints

## Setup

The easiest way to experiment with and use the code is by using the [*Google Colab Template*](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UgclyKmcOkX-6VZwaJZjRkXwVk9HCP14?usp=sharing). This is optimal for quickly inputting, plotting & comparing different disc springs.
